# Interactive_-Net_Profit_Visualization_Product_Analysis
This Python script utilizes the Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly libraries to read and analyze data from an Excel file containing product information and net profit figures. It provides an interactive bar chart visualization using Plotly Express, enabling users to explore net profits for different products with ease.

How to Use:

Make sure you have Python installed on your system along with the required libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly. You can install these libraries using pip:

Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib plotly
Download the script and save it to your local machine.

Update the excel_file_path variable in the script with the path to your Excel file containing the product data and net profit information.

Run the script. It will read the Excel file into a Pandas DataFrame, round the numerical columns to two decimal places, and create an interactive bar chart using Plotly Express.

The bar chart will display the net profit for each product. You can hover over the bars to view the exact net profit values and interact with the chart to explore the data further.

Optionally, you can customize the visualization by adjusting the plot titles, axis labels, colors, and other parameters in the script to suit your preferences.

By following these steps, you can efficiently analyze and visualize net profits for different products, gaining valuable insights to inform business decisions and drive profitability.
